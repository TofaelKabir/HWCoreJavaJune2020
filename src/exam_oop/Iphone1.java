/*
 04) Now think about a regular class Iphone1. Create a method - regularClassInfo and print out all the features of a regular class compared with Interface and Abstract class you know. what is the relation between regular class, Abstract class and Interface? Can you make a relation of Iphone1 with Phone Interface and AppleWatch Abstract class. [Write code after answering above]. [points: 30] .
