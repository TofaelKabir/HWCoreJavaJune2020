	 The code need to prepare according to the question:

Phone is an interface which has four abstract method interfaceInfo, call, message, camera and 2 non abstract method - battery and wireless which are implemented. from this 2 method -- print out what type of method they are. [for example -- "battery is a ...... method from Java ....."]. When you get a chance to implement interfaceInfo, print out answer for the following questions: [What are the features of Interface you know? Can we create constructor inside an interface? Can we write variable inside Interface? Don't copy paste, write how much you can remember, use new line, tab], for other abstract method, also print whatever you like.

Do you think we can extends or implements Interface? Single or multiple? Create two interface Pager and Wireless and One class name LandPhone. make a relation of this 3, with Phone if possible.

Assume AppleWatch is an abstract Class which have 2 method: One is abstractClassInfo [which is a non abstract method, print out all the features of an abstract class compared with Interface, regular class and Abstract class]. what type of method would be the other one - name appleWatchInfo? Think about two interface name Watch, DigitalWatch. And a regular class name AppleWatchSeries5. Can you make a relationship with AppleWatch, Watch, DigitalWatch and AppleWatchSeries5?

Now think about a regular class Iphone1. Create a method - regularClassInfo and print out all the features of a regular class compared with Interface and Abstract class. what is the relation between regualr class, Abstract class and Interface? Can you make a relation of Iphone1 with Phone Interface and Samsung Abstract class. [Write code after answering above].

Think about a class name TestPhone. Instantiate IPhone1, Samsung and Phone inside it. Call all the possible method by each of them. Go to next step after finishing till this.

Assume 4 private variable name price (as int), Info (as String, write few words when you bought it), grade (as a char, A or B), madeInUSA (as boolean) inside Iphone1 class. If the variables are private how can you use those variable? What kind of concept you can use? use it just after the variables. Now print out in TestPhone: "I bought the phone in 2000, the price was 750$, grade is A and boolean value for made in USA is: false".

NOW, Iphone1 came in 2000, but new model Iphone2, Iphone3 came in 2001. Assume Iphone1 is a super class and Iphone2, Iphone3 is child class of Iphone1. in 2002, Iphone4 come in the market which inherit Iphone2. in 2003, Iphone5 come in the market which inherit Iphone4. In 2004, Iphone6 come in the market which inherit Iphone5. Consider all of them as a class and write a method inside them related to one of the feature like map (use in Iphone3 and print out "Map is introduce in Iphone2. The price is increased to: 780$", here price is int type. When we can use a variable inside a println directly?), youtube, dropbox, photos etc. What kind of concept you can use to relate them? Instantiate all of them and call all the methods possible. 

Again, from Iphone1, we got 4 private variable. Create 2 constructor inside it -- default and parameterized after those variables. In IPhone2, declare a char variable userOfIPhone2. create default and parameterized constructor, a regular method iPhone2Info, a parameterized method with same name iPhone2Info. Use super keyword in constructor and methods in Iphone2. Also call one of the method by super(). Can you call variable by super key word? create a public variable inside Iphone1 and execute it in Iphone2. Execute all of them in TestPhone.

Now, Think about Iphone6. It also has 2 method same name materials(). They are parameterized method (int ramPrice, int cameraPrice), another one (int ramPrice, int cameraPrice, String ProcessorPrice). What kind of concept you can use? Can you use final or static method here as same method name? if yes, create them take more int variable of your own. Instantiate the class in TestPhone and initialize those methods. Now think about a class Name ConfiguredIphone6 which extends Iphone6. Override those method and change the logic at your own to show the changes. Show the output in TestPhone.

Comment out at the end of TestPhone to inform me which is hierarchical inheritance, multilevel inheritance and single inheritance
